## Savecation

Savecation is an online app that allows users to vacation on a budget in select popular locations. Users will select a location, then enter a budget and the app will suggest restaurants and tourist attractions based on that budget that the user can then schedule on a calendar.

Existing web apps, such as Tripadvisor and Airbnb, suggest places to visit and compare prices between these places but do not offer to schedule these trips on a calendar, nor do they work within a user-defined budget. We would like to improve on these existing systems by allowing the user to build a vacation schedule that is dictated by their budget.

Users of the application will be able to log in, select a city to travel to, specify a budget, and the calendar length of the stay. The application will then find restaurants and attractions based on the input and return them based on ranking. The user will have the option to make a reservation at a restaurant of their choice. The application will make use of the Google Maps, Expedia, Yelp, and OpenTable APIs.
